syslog-ng for DEBIAN
--------------------
syslog-ng doesn't have the -r switch to enable remote logging, but have a
config file option for this.
See /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf, syslog-ng.conf(5) and
/usr/share/doc/syslog-ng/html/index.html for details.

Include a logrotate and syslog-ng conf example from
