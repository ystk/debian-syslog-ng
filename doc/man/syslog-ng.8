.SH "DESCRIPTION"

NOTE: This manual page covers both editions of syslog\-ng: syslog\-ng Open Source Edition and the commercial syslog\-ng Premium Edition\. Features that are only included in the Premium Edition are marked with an asterisk (\fI*\fR)\. For details, see the official syslog\-ng website:
\fIhttp://www\.balabit\.com/network\-security/syslog\-ng/\fR\.
.PP
This manual page is only an abstract; for the complete documentation of syslog\-ng, see
\fI \fBThe syslog\-ng Administrator Guide\fR \fR\&[1]\.
.PP
The syslog\-ng application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging application\. Typically, syslog\-ng is used to manage log messages and implement centralized logging, where the aim is to collect the log messages of several devices on a single, central log server\. The different devices \- called syslog\-ng clients \- all run syslog\-ng, and collect the log messages from the various applications, files, and other
\fIsources\fR\. The clients send all important log messages to the remote syslog\-ng server, where the server sorts and stores them\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-cfgfile <file>\fR or \fB\-f <file>\fR
.RS 4
Use the specified configuration file\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-chroot <dir>\fR or \fB\-C <dir>\fR
.RS 4
Change root to the specified directory after reading the configuration file\. The directory must be set up accordingly\. Note that it is not possible to reload the syslog\-ng configuration after chrooting\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR or \fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Start syslog\-ng in debug mode\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-enable\-core\fR
.RS 4
Enable syslog\-ng to write core files in case of a crash to help support and debugging\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fd\-limit\fR
.RS 4
Set the minimal number of required file descriptors (fd\-s); this sets how many files syslog\-ng can keep open simultaneously\. Default value:
\fI4096\fR\. Note that this does not override the global ulimit setting of the host\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-foreground\fR or \fB\-F\fR
.RS 4
Do not daemonize, run in the foreground\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-group <group>\fR or \fB\-g <group>\fR
.RS 4
Switch to the specified group after initializing the configuration file\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR or \fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Display a brief help message\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-caps\fR
.RS 4
Run syslog\-ng as root, without capability\-support\. This is the default behavior\. On Linux, it is possible to run syslog\-ng as non\-root with capability\-support if syslog\-ng was compiled with the
\fI\-\-enable\-linux\-caps\fR
option enabled\. (Execute
\fBsyslog\-ng \-\-version\fR
to display the list of enabled build parameters\.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-persist\-file <persist\-file>\fR or \fB\-R <persist\-file>\fR
.RS 4
Set the path and name of the
\fIsyslog\-ng\.persist\fR
file where the persistent options and data are stored\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-pidfile <pidfile>\fR or \fB\-p <pidfile>\fR
.RS 4
Set path to the PID file where the pid of the main process is stored\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-process\-mode <pidfile>\fR
.RS 4
Sets how to run syslog\-ng: in the
\fIforeground\fR
(mainly used for debugging), in the
\fIbackground\fR
as a daemon, or in
\fIsafe\-background\fR
mode, when syslog\-ng restarts itself if it crashes\. By default, syslog\-ng runs in
\fIsafe\-background\fR
mode\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-qdisk\-dir <path>\fR or \fB\-Q <path>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the location of the file used for disk\-based buffering\. By default, this file is located at
\fI/var/lib/syslog\-ng/\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stderr\fR or \fB\-e\fR
.RS 4
Log internal messages of syslog\-ng to stderr\. Mainly used for debugging purposes in conjunction with the
\fI\-\-foreground\fR
option\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-syntax\-only\fR or \fB\-s\fR
.RS 4
Verify that the configuration file is syntactically correct and exit\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user <user>\fR or \fB\-u <user>\fR
.RS 4
Switch to the specified user after initializing the configuration file (and optionally chrooting)\. Note that it is not possible to reload the syslog\-ng configuration if the specified user has no privilege to create the
\fI/dev/log\fR
file\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Enable verbose logging used to troubleshoot syslog\-ng\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR or \fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Display version number and compilation information\.
